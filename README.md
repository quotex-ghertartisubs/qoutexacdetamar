## Is Quotex Halal or Haram?

The question of whether Quotex is halal or haram is a matter of debate.
Some scholars argue that binary options are a form of gambling, which is
prohibited in Islam. Others argue that binary options are a legitimate
form of trading and that they can be used to generate halal profits.

The Islamic Finance Council of India (IFCI) has not issued a specific
ruling on Quotex. However, the IFCI has issued a general ruling on
binary options, stating that they are permissible if they meet the
following criteria:

-   The underlying asset is Shariah-compliant.
-   The contract is clear and transparent.
-   The trader has a genuine intention to trade.

Based on the IFCI\'s general ruling, it is possible to argue that Quotex
is halal if the following conditions are met:

-   The trader is using a Shariah-compliant trading account.
-   The trader is using a trading strategy that is based on technical
    analysis.
-   The trader has a genuine intention to trade.
